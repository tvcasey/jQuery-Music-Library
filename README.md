# jQuery-Music-Library

I used my method for the jQuery Ajax with an API and it tied the append to each topic found
on the tbody, which was I believe five.  Tony showed me a real simple, clever way to sync
the data by putting the information each to their appropriate cell while using the tbody variable
as the only variable necessary to put the information in the table properly.  Now everything lines up right and has the right padding.  The data can be organized now and I may attempt to do so tommorow.  Just to see if it is easy or not.  Tim Casey.
